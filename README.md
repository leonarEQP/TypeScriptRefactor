# TypeScript Refactor Exercises

#### This project contains some exercises intentionally made to be refactored but not corrected as they do not contain bugs.

### What are we looking for refactoring?

1. Improves the readability of the code.
2. Eliminates any unnecessary duplication.
3. Better organise class responsibilities.
4. Consider using more modern or efficient methods for array operations.

### To run exercises

1. Create and go to folder project

   `mkdir refactor`

   `cd refactor`

2. Inicialize a node.js project

   `npm init -y`
